# This version of US Core has been carefully considered as a base for this IG.  This is the version we would like to use for quickest potential adoption.
%The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.us.core#6.1.0 released on 2023-06-30%

# The US Core 6.1.0 Observation profile only allows type='pattern' for category slices, so we can't use type='value'
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# These warnings are for dependency IGs, which we do not have direct control over
