# The following code system are not discoverable because they are code systems in THO, but THO doesn't define the codes. They have been checked and the identifiers are correct

# type='pattern' is dictated by US Core 6.1.0 Observation profiles for category slices, so we can't use type='value'
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
