* #functioning "Functioning" "Functioning is an umbrella term for body function, body structures, activities, and participation in societal roles. An individual's functioning and engagement represents a dynamic interaction between their health condition, environmental factors, and personal factors. Taking a broad view of health that encompasses physical, mental, and social well-being, includes optimizing functioning and engagement as a component of optimizing their health. Characterizing an individual's functioning and engagement includes both understanding the severity of an individual's signs, symptoms, impairments and limitations, and how they correspond with day-to-day activities. Functioning and engagement also serve as a key health outcome within health care."

* #body_functions "Body functions" "Body functions are the physiological functions of body systems (including psychological functions). Impairments are problems in body function or structure as a significant deviation or loss. Broad ranges of percentages are provided for those cases in which calibrated assessment instruments or other standards are available to quantify the impairment in body function. For example, when \"no impairment\" or \"complete impairment\" in body function is coded, this scaling may have margin of error of up to 5%. \"Moderate impairment\" is generally up to half of the scale of total impairment. The percentages are to be calibrated in different domains with reference to population standards as percentiles. For this quantification to be used in a uniform manner, assessment procedures need to be developed through research. For a further explanation of coding conventions in ICF, refer to Annex 2."

* #activities_and_participation "Activities and participation" "Activity is the execution of a task or action by an individual. Participation is involvement in a life situation. Activity limitations are difficulties an individual may have in executing activities. Participation restrictions are problems an individual may experience in involvement in life situations. The domains for the Activities and Participation component are given in a single list that covers the full range of life areas (from basic learning and watching to composite areas such as social tasks). This component can be used to dedefinition activities (a) or participation (p) or both. The two qualifiers for the Activities and Participation component are the performance qualifier and the capacity qualifier. The performance qualifier describes what an individual does in his or her current environment. Because the current environment brings in a societal context, performance as recorded by this qualifier can also be understood as \"involvement in a life situation\" or \"the lived experience\" of people in the actual context in which they live. This context includes the environmental factors - all aspects of the physical, social and attitudinal world, which can be coded using the Environmental Factors component. The capacity qualifier describes an individual's ability to execute a task or an action. This qualifier identifies the highest probable level of functioning that a person may reach in a given domain at a given moment. Capacity is measured in a uniform or standard environment, and thus reflects the environmentally adjusted ability of the individual. The Environmental Factors component can be used to describe the features of this uniform or standard environment. Both capacity and performance qualifiers can be used with and without assistive devices or personal assistance, and in accordance with the following scale:"
